## About The App

You have 100 cats.

One day you decide to arrange all your cats in a giant circle. Initially, none of your cats have any hats on. You walk around the circle 100 times, always starting at the same spot, with the first cat (cat # 1). Every time you stop at a cat, you either put a hat on it if it doesnâ€™t have one on, or you take its hat off if it has one on.
